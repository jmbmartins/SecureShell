# SecureShell 

## Introduction

This project aims to build a client/server system that mimics Secure Shell (SSH). The server application accepts connections from client applications, authenticates registered users, establishes session keys, and allows clients to submit commands on the host machine.

## Basic Features

- Secure client authentication.
- Encrypted communication between clients and server.
- New session keys generated for each session.
- Message authentication between clients and server.

## Advanced Features

- Cross-platform support.
- Strong authentication mechanisms.
- Mutual authentication (client and server).
- Multiple key exchange mechanisms (symmetric and asymmetric).
- Digital signature for message authentication.
- Use of elliptic curve cryptography instead of RSA.
